Jansen-MIDAS
============

This is the repository for Jansen-MIDAS, a software for segmentation of photomicrographs based on MLSS and MLSOS techniques.

**Author:** Alexandre Fioravante de Siqueira

**Description:** Jansen-MIDAS is a software developed to provide
Multi-Level Starlet Segmentation (MLSS) and Multi-Level Starlet
Optimal Segmentation (MLSOS) techniques. These methods are based on
the starlet transform, an isotropic undecimated wavelet, in order to
determine the location of objects in photomicrographs.
Using Jansen-MIDAS, a scientist can obtain a multi-level threshold
segmentation of his/hers photomicrographs.

**Version:** april 2016.
